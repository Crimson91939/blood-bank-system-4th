Zorgo:
From what I can see, it will be easier to create a Blood Bank Management System. Along with being very useful, it will
have very less variables than HR Match Making System and thus, easier for us.

Saajan:
HR will be like web based so HR cannot be done according to me.


Vivek:
Well I thought the same. We can choose Blood bank as our project for now. By the way who will make the documentation for it?

P.S. : Don't limit to these ideas. Feel free to present more. And the file names for git upoad; make them words(if possible).


Zorgo:
In my POV, this will be the easiest and also an effective project. Along with blood doner names and details, we can incorporate a system for other 
hospitals to request blood and alert hospitals if required blood is available or not and such.


Vivek: 
Yeah that's the plan.


Zorgo:
So, everyone agrees on BloodBank Database??


Vivek: 
I guess do...
