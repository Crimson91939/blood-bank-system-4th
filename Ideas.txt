A. Blood Bank Management Software

	In this project, you’ll create a Windows-based blood bank management software. The software 
must meet the following requirements:

Register a new user.
1.Store key data such as blood group, Rh factor (positive/negative), donor’s name, address, telephone
  number.
2.Retrieve above data through search.
3.Find appropriate match for a particular blood group AND Rh factor type.
4.Display amount of different blood types currently in storage.
5.You can make this application much more complex by asking for the donor’s prior medical 
  history and showing a positive match only if certain medical conditions are found to be absent,
  sending a message to the donor if storage levels for his/her blood type are low, etc.

B. HR Match Making Software

In this app, we’ll create a version of Match.com, but for job seekers and employers. The key requirements
are:

Register a new user as an employer, or a job seeker.
Create a new profile for the user. For the employee, this should include, but isn’t limited to, age, 
contact data, education level, grades, prior work experience, etc. Employers, on the other hand, should 
include their location, industry, current employee strength, vacancies, etc.
Give employers the ability to post new job requirements.
Match job seekers with new jobs that fit their requirements.
As you can imagine, you can make this program much larger by including algorithms to show desirable
candidates to employers, including a broader set of details, a Q&A section, certification tests, etc.
